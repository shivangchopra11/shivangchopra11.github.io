Hello! I am Shivang Chopra, a second-year M.S. Thesis student in the Robotics Perception and Learning Lab (RIPL) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), advised by [Prof. Zsolt Kira](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~zk15/). My research interests lie in theoretical machine learning and computer vision, with a focus on enhancing the adaptability and generalization capabilities of foundation models.

In the fall of 2023, I worked as a Computer Vision Research Intern at the [Sony R&D Center, Switzerland](https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/research/about/stuttgart-laboratory1/) in the Advanced Sensors & Modelling Group. During the summer of 2023, I interned at Amazon Science in the [Amazon Selection and Catalog Systems](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/ascs), where I developed a ranking system for newly onboarded products on Amazon.com.

Before joining Georgia Tech, I worked at [Microsoft Research Lab, India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) under the supervision of [Dr. Venkat Padmanabhan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/padmanab). There, I contributed to [Project HyWay](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/hyway/), a computer vision-based system facilitating interaction in hybrid workspaces.

I have also gained research experience as an intern at the [CARAML Lab, UT Dallas](https://www.caraml-lab.com/) under the guidance of [Dr. Rishabh Iyer](https://sites.google.com/view/rishabhiyer/home), at [IBM Research Lab India](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/india/) under the mentorship of [Dr. Sameep Mehta](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=in-sameepmehta) and [Nishtha Madaan](https://research.ibm.com/people/nishtha-madaan), at [MIDAS Lab, IIIT Delhi](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/) under the guidance of [Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/rajivratn) and at  [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) under the guidance of [Dr. Chetan Arora](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~chetan/).
