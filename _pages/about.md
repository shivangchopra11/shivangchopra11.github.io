Hi! I am Shivang Chopra, a senior year computer science undergrad at [Delhi Technological University](www.dtu.ac.in) (formerly Delhi College of Engineering), New Delhi, India. My research interests include topics in Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and Deep Learning. I am also fascinated by Augmented Reality based applications and games.

I have been working as a Research Intern at [MIDAS Lab, IIIT Delhi](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/) for the past year under the guidance of [Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/rajivratn). I am also working as a Remote Research Intern at [IBM Research India](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/india/) under the mentorship of [Nishtha Madaan](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=in-nishthamadaan), and [Sameep Mehta](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=in-sameepmehta).

In the past I have also worked as a Research Intern at [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) under the guidance of [Dr. Chetan Arora](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~chetan/) and at [Delhi Technological University](http://dtu.ac.in/) under the guidance of [Dr. Anil Singh Parihar](http://www.dtu.ac.in/Web/Departments/CSE/faculty/anilsparihar.php).
