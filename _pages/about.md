Hi! I am Shivang Chopra, a graduate student at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), pursuing masters in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning. 

Before joining GaTech, I was working as a Research Intern at Microsoft Research Lab, India under the supervision of [Dr. Venkat Padmanabhan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/padmanab). 

My primary research interests span the domains of **Theoritical Machine Learning**, **Computer Vision**, and **Natural Language Processing**. I am also fascinated by Augmented Reality based applications and games. 

In the past have worked as a Research Intern at [CARAML Lab, UT Dallas](https://www.caraml-lab.com/) under the guidance of [Dr. Rishabh Iyer](https://sites.google.com/view/rishabhiyer/home). I have also worked as a Research Intern at [IBM Research Lab India](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/india/) under the mentorship of [Dr. Sameep Mehta](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=in-sameepmehta), at [MIDAS Lab, IIIT Delhi](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/) under the guidance of [Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/rajivratn) and at  [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) under the guidance of [Dr. Chetan Arora](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~chetan/).
